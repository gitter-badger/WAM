Wesnoth Addon Manager
---------------------
This is a tool I wrote to help me and my brother manage addons for the Battle for Wesnoth game, because we frequently were removing and reinstalling specific sets of addons. I figured caching the addons on disk would speed this up, so I wrote this to make it easier- instead of manually moving the them in and out of Wesnoth's addon directory.
